/**
 @return a deep copy of the original connection request.
 
 You can think of this as the "primary" URL for a given operation. Normally this is fairly obvious:
 if uploading, it's the URL being uploaded to. When we come to support downloads, it's the URL being
 downloaded from.
 
 This can potentially get a bit tricky doing something like renaming/moving a file; in which case,
 this URL will be that of the _source_ file.
 
 ConnectionKit doesn't currently support redirects, but were it to, this URL would remain constant
 and we'd likely introduce a new `currentURL` property for retrieving the redirected URL if need be.
